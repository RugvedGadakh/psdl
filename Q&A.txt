features of pic18:
It uses havard architecture
C language friendly
it has built in power-on-reset
low power consumption


size of data memory - 2Mb

size of program memory - 4Kb


SFR- Special functiob Register

software & compiler :  MPLABxIDE  /  XC8 compiler


Number of ports : 5   PORTA(7bitS)  PORTB(8bitS)   PORTC(8bitS)  PORTD(8bitS)  PORTE(3bitS)


PORTX : it reads the corresponding input pins
LATX : reads the status of the corresponding internal port latch and not the status of the pin


Timer : PIC18 has 2 to 5 timers depending upon PIC family
they are  Timer0(8bits/16bits)   Timer1(16bits)  Timer3(8bits)   Timer4(16bits)  Timer5(16bits)


bournout reset : it is a circuit that monitors the Vdd level during operations by comparing it to a fixed threshold level.

watch dog timer : A watchdog timer (WDT) is a piece of hardware that can be used to automatically detect software anomalies and reset the processor if any occur. 

cpp module :
capture   1 or 3 timer
comapare  1 or 3 timer
PWM        2

PWM: PWM is a form of signal modulation where the widths of the pulses correspond to specific data values encoded at one end and decoded at the other.


TRIS :TRIS register is used to define the type of an I/O pin
There are two TRIS registers, the TRISA and the TRISB that correspond to the 8 pins of each port set, the A and the B1.
The TRIS registers are 8-bit registers.
The TRIS A register controls the direction of the PORT pins even when they are being used as analog inputs


ARM feature :
von neumman architecture
less power consumption
ease the application porting from one device to another



RISC VS CISC
instruction size : fixed/ varies
instruction length 4bytes/ 1 2 3 4 bytes
registers : many general purpose / few special purpose
hardware : simple / compilcated
compiler : complicates / simple



Prescaler divides the input pulse before the counter and the post scaler divides the output of the counter, both effectively increasing the range of the counter. Both prescaler and post scaler are used to get our desired frequency from a basic reference.
